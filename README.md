# Movie Analysis Project

## Aim

The goal of this project is to analyze a dataset of movies by performing data preprocessing, feature encoding, and correlation analysis to uncover insights about different factors affecting movies such as budget, gross revenue, ratings, and other attributes.

## Techniques performed

Data Handling & Cleaning: Processed raw movie dataset using Pandas.

Feature Encoding: Converted categorical values (e.g., company names, genre) into numerical representations using category encoding.

Data Visualization: Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to create heatmaps and visualize correlations between different movie attributes.

Statistical Analysis: Computed Pearson correlation coefficients to understand relationships between numeric movie features.

Python Libraries Used: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy.

## Output Achieved

Feature Transformation: Successfully converted non-numeric features into numeric values for statistical analysis.

Correlation Matrix: Generated a heatmap showcasing relationships between features like budget, gross revenue, rating, and votes.

Higher budgets tend to correlate with higher gross revenue.

User votes have a moderate correlation with movie scores.

Certain company names and directors show patterns related to movie performance.
